The terminal will prompt responses from your custom Modiji persona.

How It Works

The script sends a prompt to Together AI‚Äôs /v1/completions endpoint.

A system prompt is crafted to define the tone and personality of the assistant (e.g., like PM Modiji).

The assistant generates replies in that style, based on your prompt.
